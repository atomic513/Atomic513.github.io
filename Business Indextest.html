<strong>Our Values</strong><br><br>
&nbsp;Ever since I was a child I wanted to make a lot 
of money. I wanted 30 dabloons, 43 yugnars, -12 
bumbershoot and at least 20 brengelleng.
I figured the best way to do this was to start a business. 
The Thing Place is very special to both me 
and my employees because we are proud of the fact that 
we don't have to pay taxes since we are legally considered 
to be a church. Our customers are so satisfied with us that 
we don't even need a complaints department! Please stop 
calling us to find the number for it. It doesn't exist. 
<br>
&nbsp;People always ask me, how are your services so cheap? 
You must barely be keeping afloat. How do you even manage to 
pay your workers?
<br>
&nbsp;The simplest answer is that we don't! Since we are a church, 
our workers are all volunteers! You can become one as well!
